# `maya.cmds` Stub Generator
The goal of this project is to generate a fully typed stub for the `maya.cmds` module, that can be used with type checkers.

# Pre-generated files
The GitHub repository already contains some pre-generated stub files that are ready to be used, simply get them from the [generated-stubs](https://github.com/nils-soderman/maya-cmds-stub-generator/tree/main/generated-stubs/) folder.

# Issues
If you run into any issues with the generator or while using the generated stubs. Please open a issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nils-soderman/maya-python-cmds-stub-generator/issues).

Contributions are always welcomed!
