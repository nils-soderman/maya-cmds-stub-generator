# `maya.cmds` Stub Generator
The goal of this project is to generate a fully typed stub for the `maya.cmds` module, that can be used with type checkers.

> ⚠️ This is currently in a experimental state, expect some types & parameters to be incorrect

## What are stub files?
Stub files _(`.pyi`)_ provide type information for Python modules, enabling better IDE support with auto-completion, type checking, and docstrings.
